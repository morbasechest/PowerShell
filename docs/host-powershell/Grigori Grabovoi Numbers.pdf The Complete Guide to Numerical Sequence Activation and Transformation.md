## What are Grigori Grabovoi Numbers?
  
Grigori Grabovoi numbers are sequences of digits that form a specific frequency or vibration. According to Grabovoi, each number has a unique meaning and purpose, and by combining them in different ways, you can create codes that can influence your reality. He claims that these numbers can help you heal physical and mental illnesses, attract abundance and prosperity, improve relationships, and achieve any other desired outcome.
  
Grabovoi says that his numbers are based on the principles of radionics, which is a pseudoscientific field that studies the interaction of mind and matter through electromagnetic waves. He believes that by focusing your attention and intention on a number sequence, you can send a signal to the universe that will manifest your wish. He also says that his numbers are connected to the divine source of all creation, and that by using them, you can align yourself with the divine will and plan.
