## How to Use Maplesoft Maple for Calculus
 
Maplesoft Maple is not only a software tool for math, data analysis, visualization, and programming, but also a powerful learning environment for calculus. With Maple, you can explore, solve, and visualize calculus problems in an interactive and intuitive way. You can also use Maple to check your answers, get hints, and receive feedback on your work. Here are some ways you can use Maplesoft Maple for calculus:

- Use the Student[Calculus1] package to access commands and tools that are designed for teaching and learning calculus. This package includes commands for plotting functions and their derivatives, integrals, and Taylor series, as well as interactive tools for limits, derivatives, integrals, optimization, related rates, and more. You can also use the Student[Calculus1] package to perform single-step computations that show you how to solve calculus problems step by step.
- Use the Calculus Study Guide to review the main concepts and techniques of calculus. This study guide includes interactive tutorials that cover topics such as functions, limits, continuity, derivatives, applications of derivatives, integrals, applications of integrals, sequences and series, and differential equations. You can also use the study guide to practice your skills with exercises that have hints and solutions.
- Use the Math Apps to explore calculus concepts visually and dynamically. Math Apps are interactive applications that let you manipulate parameters and see how they affect graphs and formulas. You can find Math Apps for calculus topics such as curve sketching, optimization, Riemann sums, area between curves, volumes of revolution, arc length and surface area, Taylor polynomials and series convergence tests.
- Use the Tasks to generate calculus problems with random parameters and solutions. Tasks are templates that let you create worksheets with different levels of difficulty and customization. You can find Tasks for calculus topics such as limits, derivatives, implicit differentiation, chain rule, product rule, quotient rule, integration by parts, integration by substitution, trigonometric substitution, partial fractions decomposition, improper integrals, differential equations, and more.
- Use the Tutors to get interactive help with solving calculus problems. Tutors are dialog boxes that guide you through the steps of solving a problem with hints and feedback. You can find Tutors for calculus topics such as limits at infinity, L'Hospital's rule, curve sketching, optimization problems, related rates problems, definite integrals evaluation methods (including u-substitution), integration by parts (including tabular method), trigonometric substitution (including completing the square), partial fractions decomposition (including Heaviside cover-up method), improper integrals (including comparison test), differential equations (including separation of variables), Taylor polynomials (including remainder term), power series (including ratio test), Maclaurin series (including common series), Taylor series (including common series), convergence tests (including nth-term test), alternating series (including Leibniz test), absolute convergence (including root test), conditional convergence (including integral test), comparison tests (including limit comparison test), ratio test (including root test), root test (including ratio test).
