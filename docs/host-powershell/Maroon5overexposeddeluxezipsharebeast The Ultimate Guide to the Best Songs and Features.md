How can you tell if a file-sharing website is legal or not? There are some signs that can help you identify the legitimacy of a website. For example, a legal website will usually have a clear and transparent policy about the source and ownership of the files, the rights and responsibilities of the users, and the terms and conditions of the service. A legal website will also respect the intellectual property rights of the creators and pay them royalties or fees for their work. A legal website will also have a secure and encrypted connection that protects your privacy and data.
 
On the other hand, an illegal website will often have a vague or nonexistent policy about the files and the service, or a policy that contradicts the law. An illegal website will also disregard the intellectual property rights of the creators and offer their work for free or for a very low price. An illegal website will also have a risky and unsecured connection that can expose you to hackers, viruses, and malware.
 
Therefore, before you download any file from a file-sharing website, make sure to check its legitimacy and safety. Do some research about the website and its reputation, read its policy and terms of service, and look for any red flags or warnings. If you are not sure or have any doubts, don't download anything from that website. It is better to be safe than sorry.
